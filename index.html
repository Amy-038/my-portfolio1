                <h3>About Me!</h3>
                <p>My name is Amy Sirma, a current student of Moringa School taking full-stack software development.
                    I have a passion for learning and using technology for societal development as well as for fun.
                    I’m still new to the field but I’ve had many high-potential web and mobile app ideas that I’m certain will come to life when I’m rooted in software development.
                    I’m a great leader, being school captain in Alliance Girls’ High School, and have amazing communication and problem-solving skills.
                    I love philosophy and always enjoy picking apart anime, films and books.
                    I look forward to working with you.
